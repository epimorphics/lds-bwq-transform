The excess flow is being stored within storm sewage storage tanks at Schola Green Pumping Station.  These storage tanks are nearing capacity and this is resulting in elevated levels of storm sewage being discharged through the outfall serving Schola Green Pumping Station.  This has the potential to reduce the bathing water quality at Morecambe South and Morecambe North bathing waters.",

This is reducing the amount of flow under high flow conditions that can be treated by the works.  The excess is being stored within storm sewage storage tanks at Schola Green Pumping Station.  However, due to the recent wet weather in the area the storm storage is full.  This is resulting is higher than normal levels of storm sewage being discharged through the outfall serving Schola Green Pumping Station.

United Utilities isolated the damaged section of sewer and arranged a fleet of nine tankers to collect sewage from the pumping stations and transport it to Lancaster WwTW.  Following rainfall on Monday 30th April United Utilities reported on Tuesday 1st May that they were unable to keep on top of flows and a continuous discharge of 20 l/s was being made from Riverside Pumping Station.  The repair was made by United Utilities on 5th May by replacing the damaged rising main sewer section.",
