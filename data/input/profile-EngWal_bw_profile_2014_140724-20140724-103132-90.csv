"03600","Northumberland","Spittal Beach is a gently sloping resort beach approximately one kilometre long situated immediately south of the mouth of the River Tweed.","The River Tweed rises over 100km to the west and drains a catchment of approx 4000 sq km. The lower part of the catchment which influences bathing water quality is predominantly devoted to arable and livestock farming. The historic town of Berwick-upon-Tweed and its satellites, Spittal and Tweedmouth, lie at the mouth of the estuary.","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing European standards. It is natural for water to run off the land to the sea. Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","The Tweed Estuary discharges to the sea at the north end of the bathing water. Diffuse run off from agricultural land and upstream settlements affects the bacteriological quality of the river. After heavy rain, this can have a short-term impact on bathing water quality.  High river flows also shorten residence times in the estuary, exacerbating the impact of discharges from the sewerage system in and around Berwick.","The Environment Agency's investigations have been aimed at identifying non water company sources of pollution that may be affecting the bathing water so that we can implement measures to address them.  We believe that agricultural sources in the Tweed catchment may be significant, particularly in wet weather, although we have not found evidence pointing to any particularly important source.","Since 1995, the Environment Agency have worked closely with Northumbrian Water to identify and deliver significant investment in the sewage infrastructure around this bathing water.  Most recently, an investigation by Northumbrian water into the effects of their systems on bating water quality has led to improvements at 2 CSOs.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","Sewage from Berwick, Spittal and Tweedmouth is treated at a sewage works that discharges to the Tweed estuary to the west of the town.","The majority of sewers in England are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","A combined sewer overflow (CSO) which could discharge onto the beach during heavy rainfall was removed in early 2012.  Other CSOs discharge to the estuary and contribute to pollution at the bathing water when river flows are high during wet weather.","Heavy rain falling on pavements and roads often flows into surface water drains or highway drains, ending up in local rivers and ultimately the sea. The quality of bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.",,"Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.","The catchment of the River Tweed is largely agricultural with a mixture of arable and livestock farming. During and after periods of heavy rainfall, runoff from agricultural areas will be greatly increased. The quality of the bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.  The limited data collected on sources of bacteria suggests that livestock are a significant source, particularly when river flows are high, and we are aiming to raise awareness of this in the farming community.",,,"Seaweed (macroalgae) and phytoplankton (microscopic algae) are a natural part of the marine and freshwater environment.

There are two outfalls within the bathing water area at Withernsea; an emergency overflow within close proximity to the bathing water monitoring point and a storm overflow at the southern end of the bathing water area. The operation of this storm overflow may sometimes result in reduced bathing water quality. The emergency overflow next to the bathing water monitoring point has been designed to operate only under severe weather conditions or when there are problems sewerage network system.

Attention was drawn to the large resident population of pigeons that roosted under the pier.  Examination of the sand under the pier, especially early in the morning when the tide had been out overnight, showed significant deposits of pigeon faeces.  As part of the investigations, dye was placed on the sand ahead of a rising tide to mimic the movement of the pigeon faecal contamination.  This dye stayed close to the surf line and appeared to concentrate as it flowed past the designated sample point.

"14200","Rother District","Bexhill is a resort beach situated between Eastbourne and Hastings. The beach is predominantly shingle, with shallow sandflats exposed at low water. Above the beach there is a promenade, followed by the urban backdrop of the town of Bexhill. Egerton Park Stream and the overflow from Egerton Park Lake drain onto the beach through two outfall pipes in the west of the bathing water.","The natural drainage (hydrological) catchment surrounding the bathing water comprises approximately 700 hectares of the urban area of Bexhill. The upper catchment slopes steeply. Egerton Park Stream originates in Glenleigh Park and runs through urban Bexhill mainly culverted.

Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","Egerton Park Stream drains onto the beach 140 metres west of the bathing water sampling point. The stream runs through an urban catchment, which includes a number of storm overflows. inputs into the river occur when heavy rainfall overwhelms the sewerage system and causes diluted sewage to overflow.","The Environment Agency investigated the surface water and sewer system in Bexhill in the late 1990s. As a consequence, storm overflows across the catchment were upgraded. A wrongly connected waste water pipe entering Egerton Park stream in Wainwright Road was rectified prior to the 1999 bathing season. Joint surveys by Southern Water Services and the Environment Agency during 1999 demonstrated, however, that contamination persisted in the main culvert. Since then, investigations have focused on the catchment of Egerton Park Stream. The Environment Agency recently introduced a DNA tracing technique that helps us identify whether sources of faecal pollution are human or animal. In 2009, this method was used at sites across the catchment of Egerton Park Stream, enabling us to target further investigations and identify appropriate courses of corrective action.","Fifteen storm overflows in the Bexhill catchment were upgraded between 1998 and 2000. Treatment was installed on the long sea outfalls at Combe Haven and Bulverhythe and at Hastings sewage treatment works prior to the 2003 bathing season.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","Bexhill and Hastings sewage treatment works at Galley Hill was upgraded to treatment in 2003. The sewage treatment works discharges through the twin long sea outfalls at Bulverhythe and Combe Haven.","The majority of sewers in England are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","There are 15 storm overflows in the Bexhill area. Five storm overflows are within the immediate catchment of Egerton Park Stream, which drains onto the beach 140 metres west of the bathing water sampling point. Egerton Road storm overflow is the one closest to the beach. Polegrove and Richmond Road storm overflows discharge via the Egerton Park Lake outfall. Discharges into the river occur when heavy rainfall overwhelms the sewerage system and causes diluted sewage to overflow.
Southern Water carried out an investigation of the performance of their CSOs between 2005 and 2007. All CSOs met operational overflow requirements designed not to affect bathing water compliance. 
There are another two CSOs that discharge onto the beach 2 km either side of the bathing water. One is located off Hartfield Road in the west, the other one at the foot of Galley Hill to the East.
Discharges occur when heavy rainfall overwhelms the sewerage system. This can result in a lower standard of water quality after rainfall.","Heavy rain falling on pavements and roads often flows into surface water drains or highway drains, ending up in local rivers and ultimately the sea. The quality of bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.","In 2006, the Rother District Council requested the Environment Agency to move the bathing water sampling point. At the beginning of 2008 bathing water season, the sampling point was relocated 360 metres towards the east.

Highcliffe Castle is a sand and shingle beach resort, approximately one kilometre wide, backed by woodland covered cliffs.","The catchment surrounding Christchurch Highcliffe Castle is approximately 300,000 hectares and includes the Hampshire Avon and the River Stour. The Avon is approximately 95km long and rises in Wiltshire in the Vale of Pewsey. It then flows south across Salisbury Plain through Durrington, Amesbury and Salisbury where all the significant tributaries of the Avon come together, including the Nadder, Wylye, Bourne and Ebble. The upper Avon catchment includes the undulating, chalk downlands of Salisbury Plain, which are cut by steep combes and river valleys. The steep catchment means rain runs off rapidly into the river. To the south of Salisbury the Avon enters the rolling farmland of the Hampshire Basin, flowing along the western edge of the New Forest through Fordingbridge and Ringwood. The Avon meets the River Stour at Christchurch and flows into Christchurch Harbour and the English Channel at Mudeford.

We have checked the local sewerage system for misconnections. We are working with Torbay Council and South West Water to identify and rectify any problems.
Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.",,,"There are some private discharges with potential to cause pollution, however at present the Environment Agency do not believe these are a source of pollution to the bathing water.

It is a sandy beach resort, approximately 180 metres wide, backed by cliffs. A stream flows across the beach to the sea.","The catchment surrounding Salcombe South Sands is approximately 8,800 hectares. The Combe Stream is approximately two and a half kilometres long and descends to the Salcombe Kingsbridge Estuary at the beach from the village of Malborough. The estuary is unusual because it has no large river feeding it, just a series of small streams rising from springs at Frogmore, Bowcombe, Batson, East Allington, Sherford and other surrounding villages. 
The estuary is tidal to Kingsbridge, and like the other estuaries of South Devon, the original deep river valley has been flooded by sea level rise, to create a wide expanse of water with secluded creeks and side arms. Woodland fringes come down to the high tide line, and the areas of saltmarsh or grazing marsh are quite restricted. Kingsbridge and Salcombe are the main urban areas and land use is rural.

Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain.

"27200","Cornwall County Council","Polkerris is on the south coast of Cornwall. It is a small, remote sandy bay, approximately 170 metres wide, surrounded by cliffs.","The catchment surrounding Polkerris is approximately 7,200 hectares. There are no streams flowing directly onto the beach. The catchment includes the Par River and tributaries, including Tywardreath Stream, Bokiddick Brook, Carbis Stream and Treverbyn Stream. The Par River rises near the A30 then flows for approximately 14.5km before reaching the sea. The upper half of the catchment follows fairly level ground, then quickly drops after it enters the steep sided Luxulyan. 
Much of the remainder of the river flows within wide flood plains. In the past the Par River has been affected by the China clay industry. The combined effects of clay mining, cross catchment transfers and the porous nature of the catchment, have reduced runoff from the steep gradient of the Par River resulting in reduced peak flows to the bathing water. 
The catchment is mostly agricultural, with more than 50 farms. The rural areas are dominated by improved grassland with smaller areas of arable, woodland and a significant area where china clay mining dominates the landscape. Urban areas include Par, Tywardreath, Luxulyan, Roche, and the small fishing village of Polkerris is behind the beach. The catchment is within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing European standards.

"31400","Cornwall County Council","The Towans (Godrevy) is on the north coast of Cornwall. It is a sand and rock beach resort, approximately 670 metres wide, backed by sand dunes.","The catchment surrounding The Towans (Godrevy) is approximately 6,200 hectares. The Red River enters St Ives Bay approximately 280m north of the Environment Agency monitoring point at Godrevy, and the Hayle Estuary system is approximately three kilometres (km) to the south. The Red River is approximately 13km (35km long including major tributaries) and rises from springs near Bolenowe. The steep catchment means rain runs off rapidly into the river.
In the past the Red River has been affected by the mining industry at Tuckingmill, Pool, Redruth, and Camborne. Land use in the rural areas is mostly arable near the coast and improved grassland with some dairy farming on the higher ground. Much of the coast in this part of Cornwall has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing European standards. It is natural for water to run off the land to the sea. Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","Streams and rivers are typically affected by human sewage, animal slurry and runoff from roads. The Red River flows onto this beach. The Environment Agency have monitored the river since 1986 and found that water quality is worse during and after heavy rainfall.","The Environment Agency carried out additional monitoring in the Red River in 2010, and will make recommendations for further improvements to protect and improve the bathing water quality.","The sewage treatment scheme for Penzance and St Ives was completed by South West Water in early 1995. The scheme included extensive sewerage, improvements to intermittent discharges and the removal of untreated sewage discharges.

The Hayle STW was enlarged and upgraded in 1995 and again in 2000. 
Improvements were made to the Knave-Go-By combined sewer overflow (CSO) in the Red River catchment in 1999, as part of the Camborne and Redruth sewage treatment scheme. This scheme was completed by December 2001, and included improvements to the Reskadinnick CSO.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","Sewage from Hayle is pumped to Hayle STW for treatment, and discharges to the sea 2.3km from the bathing water.

"33300","Cornwall County Council","Polzeath Beach is just north of the Camel Estuary on the north coast of Cornwall. It is a sandy beach resort, approximately 640 metres wide, with a stream flowing across it. The beach is backed by cliffs and there are plenty of rock pools.","The catchment surrounding Polzeath is approximately 40,900 hectares and includes the Camel Estuary. Polzeath bathing water is influenced by the Camel Estuary system, the Polzeath Brook, and the Trenant Stream. The Polzeath Brook is approximately four and a half kilometres (km) long and flows from the village of St Minver through farmland and a caravan site at Polzeath village before flowing across the beach. The Trenant Stream is 900m long and joins the Polzeath Brook 60m upstream of the beach. There is also a small stream one and a half kilometres long, which flows from the settlement of Pentireglaze to the northern end of Polzeath beach. The steep catchment means rain runs off rapidly into the streams.
The River Camel rises at 280m on Hendraburnick Down on Bodmin Moor, and drains the area between Bodmin Moor and Padstow including a diverse range of farming landscapes. It flows for approximately 40km over steep terrain before joining the estuary near Wadebridge. The estuary then meets the sea near Padstow. 
The Camel Valley and its major tributaries the rivers Allen, Ruthern and De Lank are currently designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). They have also been attributed Special Area of Conservation (SAC) status under the European Union Habitats Directive, due to the presence of otters and bullheads. Further designations include Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) status for the Camel Estuary and Area of Great Landscape Value (AGLV) status for the Camel and Allen valleys. 
Historically, mining and quarrying were important industries with slate quarrying still occurring at Delabole, towards the top of the River Allen. The upper and middle reaches of the Camel are essentially moorland, passing into woodland. Most of the undulating land is used for livestock farming, with mixed farming/rough grazing on the poorer land. The catchment includes the larger settlements of Bodmin, Wadebridge, Padstow and Camelford.","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing European standards. It is natural for water to run off the land to the sea. Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","Streams and rivers are typically affected by human sewage, animal slurry and runoff from roads. The Polzeath Brook and Trenant Stream both flow across this beach. The Environment Agency have monitored the Polzeath Stream since 1989 and found that it can affect water quality after heavy rainfall.","The Environment Agency carried out additional monitoring in the Polzeath Brook in 2010, and will make recommendations for further improvements to protect and improve the bathing water quality.","The South West Water sewage treatment scheme known as the Trevone Scheme collects sewage from the various settlements around the Camel Estuary. It is split into two schemes centred on the Porthilly sewage treatment works (STW) (East Bank Scheme), and a works at Trecerus near Padstow (West Bank Scheme). 
Porthilly STW received ultraviolet (UV) disinfection in 1996 for sewage from Rock, Polzeath, and Tredrizzick, and improvements were made to the sewerage in Rock and Polzeath. Trecerus STW was completed for the 1997 bathing season with chemically assisted sedimentation and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection for sewage from St Merryn, Trevone and Padstow. Improvements were also made to the sewerage in Padstow, St Merryn, Harlyn and Trevone at that time. The treatment was subsequently upgraded to full secondary treatment and UV disinfection by April 2004.
Improvements to seven storm overflows to the Camel Estuary at Padstow Harbour, Rock pumping station (PS), Eddystone Road (Wadebridge PS), and Porthilly combined sewer overflow (CSO) were also completed by April 2004, and improvements to Padstow South Quay CSO, Moyles Road and Egloshayle PS were completed by August 2004. The installation of UV disinfection at Wadebridge STW was completed by July 2004.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","Sewage from Polzeath is pumped to Porthilly STW for treatment. The outfall from the Porthilly STW discharges to the River Camel Estuary approximately 5.2km from the bathing water. This discharge is disinfected and designed to protect bathing water quality.","The majority of sewers in England are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","There is an emergency/storm overflow from the Polzeath pumping station, that discharges to the Polzeath Brook 250m from the Environment Agency monitoring point. There is also an emergency/storm overflow from the New Polzeath pumping station, that discharges to the sea 500m from the Environment Agency monitoring point. 
The operation of the overflows can lead to a drop in water quality in the Polzeath Brook and Polzeath bathing water.","Heavy rain falling on pavements and roads often flows into surface water drains or highway drains, ending up in local rivers and ultimately the sea. The quality of bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.","Surface water can flow into the Polzeath Brook and Trenant Stream and onto the beach from the surrounding urban area and highway drains. This can affect bathing water quality, particularly after periods of rainfall. The Environment Agency have regularly inspected and sampled surface water outfalls.","Wrongly connected domestic waste water pipes can also affect the bathing water quality.

"34000","North Devon District Council","Instow Beach is within the Taw/Torridge Estuary on the north coast of Devon. It is a sandy beach resort, approximately 1.1 kilometres wide, backed by sand dunes and Instow town.","The catchment surrounding Instow is approximately 206,600 hectares, and includes the enormous catchment draining the Taw/Torridge Estuary. There is a stream approximately two and a half kilometres long that flows from the east through farmland before entering the estuary at the beach 400m south of the Environment Agency monitoring point. 
The River Torridge is 77km long and rises on a gently rolling plateau at Baxworthy Cross near Hartland. The river falls steeply to the estuary at Bideford. The River Okement, a major tributary of the Torridge, also rises on Dartmoor. The upper estuary is narrow, meandering and muddy, and joins the River Taw from the east at Appledore Pool forming a broader joint estuary. 
The River Taw rises at Taw Head within Dartmoor National Park and is fed by three major tributaries: the River Yeo (Lapford), the River Mole and the Little Dart River. The Taw flows north through scenic valleys before joining the estuary at Newbridge above Barnstaple. The steep catchment means rain runs off rapidly into the rivers and estuary.
Most of the catchment is rural and sparsely populated. The main urban areas are around the Taw Estuary at Barnstaple, Braunton, Bickington, Fremington and Yelland. Agriculture is the primary industry, and this is mostly dairy and livestock farming. Tourism and recreation are the major industries around the estuary and coast. Other industries include quarrying for sandstone, light industry, timber processing, fish farming and the generation of hydroelectric power.","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing European standards.

The beach has a shallow slope and a very large tidal range so that it can be up to half a kilometre to the sea at low tide. The rivers Brue and Parrett both flow into the Bristol Channel just south of the bathing water.","The catchment surrounding Burnham Jetty North is approximately 222,000 hectares. The Parrett, Huntspill and Brue rivers flow from the steep uplands of the Quantocks, Blackdown Hills and Mendips. The rivers flow north and west into the extensive low-lying floodplain of the Somerset Levels and Moors through various man-made drainage channels to the Severn Estuary at Bridgwater Bay. The steep catchment means rain runs off rapidly into the rivers. Rivers and other streams in the Somerset Levels are controlled by sluices which manage the volume of freshwater entering Bridgwater Bay
The River Parrett is 60km long and flows through Dorset and Somerset to its mouth at Burnham-on-Sea. The main tributaries of the Parrett are the rivers Isle, Tone, Yeo and Cary. The Tone joins the tidal Parrett 30km inland at Burrowbridge. The River Cary rises at Castle Cary and flows west into the man-made King’s Sedgemoor Drain at Henley Corner. It continues across the Somerset Moors and joins the tidal River Parrett downstream of Bridgwater at Dunball Sluice. 
The River Huntspill is a man-made river in the Sedgemoor district of the Somerset Levels that joins the River Parrett just south of Highbridge.

The animal contribution is possibly more significant in the River Axe, and the human contribution more significant in the Uphill Great Rhyne. 
Between 2009 and 2013 the Environment Agency have walked the catchment in wet and dry weather conditions, and sampled various tributaries of the Uphill Great Rhyne.  In 2011, the Environment Agency identified a chronic sewer leak into the Uphill Great Rhyne, promptly fixed by Wessex Water.

Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","The River Keekle, which joins the River Ehen south of Cleator village, and the River Calder flow into the Irish Sea to the north of the bathing water at Sellafield. These rivers can be a source of reduced water quality after heavy rainfall. 
The Whitriggs Beck flows across the beach to the sea. The flow, however, can only be seen during periods of higher flow such as following rainfall. Under low flow conditions it disappears underground before reaching the beach foreshore. There are known issues with this beck which may impact bathing water quality. The Environment Agency is acting to resolve these.
The Croft Head Stream flows across the beach at its northern end. There are known issues with this beck which may impact bathing water quality. The Environment Agency is acting to resolve these.","In 1999 the Environment Agency carried out an assessment of pollution sources that could affect bathing water quality at the Seascale and St Bees bathing waters. This work has guided actions taken to improve bathing water quality on this stretch of coast including the provision of improved treatment at the Cleator and Seascale Sewage Treatment Works by United Utilities in 2003. 
In 2008 the Environment Agency carried out a survey of the River Ehen and the River Calder which join and flow to the Irish Sea at Sellafield to the north of Seascale bathing water. The survey assessed the impact the rivers can have on bathing water quality at Seascale. These results were used in an assessment carried out in 2008 by United Utilities on the impact of their assets on Seascale bathing water.
In 2011 the Environment Agency surveyed streams and rivers in this area to identify sources of contamination. The findings are being followed up to improve bathing water quality. 
The Environment Agency is currently investigating a solution to the source of contamination to the Whitriggs Beck with Copeland Borough Council, United Utilities and Cumbria County Council.  Natural England has also been involved providing advice to local farmers to reduce their impact on water quality.","Sea Change, a £500 million coastal clean-up project, was launched in 1994 by the Environment Agency in conjunction with United Utilities. It aims to improve the bathing water quality in the North West. Through this a £10 million scheme to provide a new sewage treatment works and pumping station at Seascale was built by United Utilities. The sewage treatment works discharges to the Irish Sea via a two kilometre long sea outfall. There is a storm overflow from the sewage treatment works to the Whitriggs Beck. This operates infrequently when the flows arriving at the sewage treatment works are increased due to rainfall. The sewage treatment works was upgraded in 2003 by United Utilities to provide disinfection of the discharge to protect bathing water quality. 
Cleator Sewage Treatment Works which discharges to the River Ehen to the north of Seascale was upgraded by United Utilities in 2003 to provide disinfection of the discharge to protect bathing water quality. 
In 2000 United Utilities provided treatment to the sewage flows from the outfall at Braystones. In 2004 the treatment was upgraded to improve water quality. This will have helped protect bathing water quality at Seascale.
In 2008 United Utilities assessed all discharges that could impact on bathing water. This included assets operated by United Utilities, assets operated by Sellafield Limited and the impact of local rivers and streams on the bathing water. The assessment concluded that no further improvements were needed to United Utilities assets to improve bathing water compliance. The assessment identified the River Keekle which joins the River Ehen at Cleator as the main contributor to reducing bathing water quality.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","Seascale Sewage Treatment Works discharges via a long sea outfall which is designed to protect bathing water quality.","The majority of sewers in England are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","There is a storm overflow located to the north of the bathing water. There are, however, no known issues with this overflow. 
There is a pumping station located close to the beach known as Seascale Foreshore Pumping Station. This can discharge sewage under emergency conditions but there are no known operational issues with this pumping station. 
There are two surface water outfalls that discharge to the beach. The outfalls discharge clean surface water and do not impact bathing water quality.
Under the proposed future programme of work for United Utilities (from 2015 to 2020) all storm overflows close to bathing waters will have equipment installed to monitor spills to the environment. This will help to identify where bathing water improvements may be needed in the future.","Heavy rain falling on pavements and roads often flows into surface water drains or highway drains, ending up in local rivers and ultimately the sea. The quality of bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.",,"Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.
Four suspected misconnections are being investigated under United Utilities proposed improvement programme by the end of 2015.  The improvement of any misconnected properties found will help improve bathing water quality.","The Ehen catchment, which includes the sub-catchment of the River Keekle, lies to the north of Seascale bathing water. It is largely agricultural with significant areas of land used for livestock. During and following periods of heavy rainfall, run off from agricultural areas will be greatly increased which could impact bathing water quality at Seascale.   
Catchment Sensitive Farming, which is delivered by Natural England in partnership with the Environment Agency, delivers practical solutions and targeted support to enable farmers and land managers to take voluntary action to reduce diffuse water pollution from agriculture to protect water bodies and the environment.  Actions include a programme of educational events for farmers, advice to farmers and land managers, farm visits, and surveys of the area to identify pollution risks. A project is currently underway within the River Keekle catchment focusing on reducing the impact on water quality from farms. Additionally advice has also been given to farmers within the Whitriggs Beck catchment which is known to impact on Seascale bathing water quality.","We are working with Sellafield Limited to investigate the potential impact of non-radioactive discharges from the Sellafield site.  The primary focus is on sewage originating from the toilet facilities provided on site for the Sellafield workforce.  The work is considering whether the level of sewage treatment needs to be enhanced to improve and protect the bathing water quality at Seascale thus protecting public health.",,"Seaweed (macroalgae) and phytoplankton (microscopic algae) are a natural part of the marine and freshwater environment.

The programme, which is primarily concerned with the nutrient load to the lake, also aims to improve bathing water quality.
In 2009 a study was carried out by the Environment Agency on the three bathing waters in Lake Windermere building on a similar study carried out in 2000. The sources affecting bathing water quality in the lake are driven to a large extent by the prevailing weather conditions particularly wind. The study found that the bathing water quality at Lakeside can be influenced by a number of small streams including the Wilfin Beck, Low Cunsey Farm Beck and Gill Beck. The impact of the Windermere Sewage Treatment Works at Tower Wood on bathing water quality in the lake is dependant on the wind direction and strength. 
In 2009 the Environment Agency repeated an earlier campaign carried out in 2002 which looked at the sewage disposal from boats on the lake to protect bathing water quality.

The beach faces south west into Swansea Bay and is located between two large rivers, the River Neath to the north west and River Afan to the south east. Directly behind the beach, is the industrial town of Port Talbot. The water quality sample point is located opposite the roundabout along the sea front, off the slip near the coastguard station.","The natural drainage (hydrological) catchment surrounding the bathing water is highly diverse. The towns of Neath and Port Talbot are located in the lower catchment of the bathing water, with several smaller urban areas located along the length of the two rivers. These urban areas comprise a mixture of residential and light industrial land use. There is also substantial heavy industry to the south east of the beach incorporating a large deepwater dock with associated shipping traffic. Higher up in the catchment, there are large areas of forestry land, active mines and upland hill farming (predominantly sheep).","It is the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing European standards. It is natural for water to run off the land to the sea. Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","Streams and rivers are typically affected by sewage, agricultural and industrial run off from further up the catchment. During and after periods of heavy rainfall, runoff from all these areas will be greatly increased. As a result, reduced water quality may persist in watercourses for some time after rainfall has occurred. The water quality at Aberafan is affected by the freshwater of two large rivers, the Afan and Neath. In recent years water quality failures have been regularly recorded after periods of prolonged or heavy rainfall.","Natural Resources Wales works with Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council, Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water and privately permitted discharge consent holders to establish sources of pollution affecting water quality at Aberafan bathing water. 
Inspections are carried out by Natural Resources Wales in partnership with the local authority and the water company. These are carried out pre-season (before the 1st of May) and mid season if required (during the bathing water season).","Natural Resources Wales works closely with Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water to identify, investigate and resolve problems affecting bathing water quality.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England and Wales since the 1980s.","Two large wastewater treatment works discharge their final effluent into Swansea Bay, via long sea outfalls. One of these works has ultra-violet treatment, which is designed to reduce the levels of bacteria in the final effluent, which will help to improve bathing water quality. These works also have emergency and storm outlets which, when operating will discharge screened effluent into Swansea Bay. There are also seven smaller sewage treatment works located along the length of the River Neath which also have storm and/or emergency overflows.","The majority of sewers in England and Wales are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","There are no direct discharges from the sewage network onto the bathing beach. However, there are several sewage pumping stations with emergency and storm overflows located within in the tidal zones of the Rivers Afan and Neath. These protect domestic properties in Aberafan from being flooded by sewage and storm water during heavy rainfall. There could be an adverse impact on bathing water quality following periods of heavy rainfall, when these discharges operate.","Heavy rain falling on pavements and roads often flows into surface water drains or highway drains, ending up in local rivers and, ultimately, the sea. The quality of bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.","Immediately behind Aberafan bathing water are Sandfields and Aberafan, urban areas of Port Talbot.

These can have a detrimental impact on the bathing water quality. Natural Resources Wales is working with Neath Port Talbot council and Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water to identify and resolve these sources of pollution.
Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system.

At Swansea a unique model has been developed by the Smart Coasts Sustainable Communities Project that predicts water quality at the designated bathing water.  The model is run during the Bathing Water season and the prediction is used to let people know if the water quality is good or poor.

This information is provided by way of a sign on the slipway to the beach, on the City and County of Swansea’s website and via twitter.  The prediction is updated 3 times a day during the week and twice on the weekend.  Last year the sign said good 52% and poor 48% of the time.  There are 139 days in the bathing water season.  On 37 of those days the sign stayed good all day.  On 46 days the sign had to be changed to poor once and on 25 days it had to be changed to poor twice.  On 31 days the sign stayed poor all day.

Daylight improves water quality so, generally, water quality improves as the day goes on.

Natural Resources Wales, Aberystwyth University and City and County of Swansea are working together on the Smart Coasts project funded by Interreg to the tune of 2 million euro. The project has started a bacterial source apportionment study into the sources of bacteria in the Swansea Bay area. One of the aims of the project is to determine the cause of reduced water quality in Swansea Bay. 

In 2011 and 2012, blackbox modelling data acquisition, source apportionment data acquisition and offshore studies were carried out. The data is still being analysed but preliminary results have been presented to the partners by the project. These results have already been used to target our pollution prevention investment for 2013.","In 1999, the Swansea sewer system was significantly upgraded and a new wastewater treatment system was installed at Fabian Way. This resulted in a vast improvement to the water quality in Swansea Bay.
Since then, Natural Resources Wales has worked with Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water to make further improvements to the sewerage system and Swansea Wastewater Treatment Works.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England and Wales since the 1980s.","Swansea Wastewater Treatment Works discharges offshore to the east of Swansea Bay.

In the catchment of Swansea Bay, there are numerous storm, emergency and surface water outfalls, that discharge into the Tawe River. These protect domestic properties in Swansea and Mumbles from being flooded by sewage during periods of heavy rainfall. However, sewer overflows operating during and following periods of heavy rain can result in a deterioration in the quality of the water in the River Tawe and at Swansea Bay bathing waters.
In recent years, telemetry equipment has been installed in most of the overflows by the water company. This technology has allowed Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water to respond to warnings of blockages in the sewerage system and has reduced the number of actual and potential overflows.

DCWW are currently developing a solution to decrease the number of spills to the designated bathing water from the sewerage network. Key assets have been identified and the solution is likely to focus on surface water reduction and network alterations. The cost of these solutions is likely to be significant and will be met through the AMP programme.

"37940","Sir Benfro - Pembrokeshire","This sandy beach is approximately 500 metres across, faces south east over Carmarthen Bay and lies in front of a public car park and a popular pub. Within close proximity are several popular caravan and camp sites. A small river known as Fords Lake, which drains land to the north, flows into Carmarthen Bay and is an important freshwater influence to the bathing water. The bathing water lies within the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation and the surrounding area forms part of the Saundersfoot to Telpyn Site of Special Scientific Interest. The bathing water is also located within Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, further highlighting the environmental value of the area. The bathing water sample point lies at the centre of the beach.","The natural drainage (hydrological) catchment surrounding the bathing water comprises largely of dairy pasture and sheep grazing. Closer to the beach there are several caravan sites and small settlements. Fords Lake (a small river) drains land to the north and flows through the attractive ‘Pleasant Valley’ woodland before issuing out onto of the beach","It is the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing European standards. It is natural for water to run off the land to the sea. Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","Streams and rivers are typically affected by sewage or industrial run off from further up the catchment. Wiseman’s Bridge bathing water may be influenced by the run off of surface water draining surrounding pastoral land during wet weather conditions. Run off from roads, properties and urban storm drainage may also influence bathing water quality. Reduced water quality at this beach may be experienced following heavy rain. Contributions from both private and public sewerage systems may also impact river water quality. 
Wiseman’s Bridge is part of a long bay which has numerous freshwater inputs from other catchments within close proximity. Conditions within these catchments may have an impact upon this bathing water.","Inspections are carried out in partnership with the Pembrokeshire County Council and Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water. These are carried out pre-season (before the 1st May) and mid-season, if required (during the bathing water season).

This beach was newly designated for 2012. Investigations carried out by Natural Resources Wales during 2012 have helped to identify potential pollution sources to the bathing water with a view to reducing their impact. 

Problems were discovered with residential and commercial sewage discharges. In some circumstances the discharges were found to be having a minimal impact but required registration as exempt. Larger discharges were discovered without Environmental Permits and considerable work has been undertaken to provide pre-application advice to ensure these are legalised and ultimately compliant with the forthcoming permits. Whilst one cess pit was discovered as a significant pollution source, there are several others which require careful monitoring and improvements sought as required.

It is uncertain whether full sewage discharge compliance in the Step aside – Wisemans Bridge area would make the required improvements to significantly lower the risk of failing Guideline or Imperative bathing water standards. Further modelling may provide a clearer picture of the capacity of this area to receive treated sewage discharges.

In the upper catchment there are continued pollution risks from land management in the agricultural sector. Land use and farm infrastructure will continue to be monitored. The storage and spreading of slurries on land that has been compacted through poor management or during poor soil / weather conditions are likely to be the highest risks here.

Improvements made over the next three years will be critical in helping Wiseman‟s Bridge bathing water meet the Sufficient or Good Status of the revised Bathing Water Directive. Further there is a potential for Wiseman‟s Bridge to become a Site of High Public Interest revolving around the threat that this popular beach could have signs erected advising of pollution if further improvements are not made by the end of 2015.","Natural Resources Wales has developed a good working relationship with Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water and liaises regularly to identify problems that could affect bathing water quality","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England and Wales since the 1980s.","The Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water sewage treatment works at Templeton discharges directly to Fords Lake. However, this sewage treatment works is in the head waters of the catchment which will reduce its impact on bathing water quality.","The majority of sewers in England and Wales are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","Discharges from combined sewer overflows can occur within the vicinity of the bathing water. These discharges occur when heavy rainfall overwhelms the sewerage system and causes diluted sewage to spill. This protects domestic properties in the catchment from being flooded by sewage during heavy rainfall.
There are combined sewer overflows located within the catchment which may, under severe weather conditions discharge untreated sewage effluent to surface waters interacting with Wiseman’s Bridge bathing water.","Heavy rain falling on pavements and roads often flows into surface water drains or highway drains, ending up in local rivers and, ultimately, the sea.

The River Ritec drains land to the north and west, flowing in to the sea at Tenby and is the dominant freshwater influence to the bathing water. There is also a small stream running down the beach which drains marshland behind the dune system. The bathing water lies within 1 km of the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation and the surrounding area forms part of the Lydstep Head to Tenby Burrows Site of Special Scientific Interest. The bathing water is also located within Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, further highlighting the environmental value of the area. The bathing water sample point lies at the centre of the beach.","The natural drainage (hydrological) catchment surrounding the bathing water is approximately 40 square kilometres. The River Ritec feeds into a culvert at Tenby South Beach, issuing into the sea just offshore. This river drains the town of Tenby, the village of St Florence and a large agricultural area.

This work includes tracing the sources of pollution from domestic toilet and utility misconnections that discharge to the private and public surface water system, and subsequently enter the River Clwyd itself or enter drains that discharge directly onto the bathing beach at Rhyl.","Wrongly connected waste water pipes can affect the water quality of rivers and the sea. Misconnections in the Rhyl area, and the wider Clwyd catchment, have been investigated and resolved, and any further suspected misconnections will be investigated as they arise.","Farming dominates the Clwyd Valley, in particular dairy, beef and sheep farming.  A project was established in 2006 to improve water quality across the River Clwyd by minimising the impact of diffuse pollution runoff from farms.  This work has continued since, and is now also driven by the need to comply with the Water Framework Directive targets for inland and coastal waters.  Many farms in the main Clwyd valley and also several sub-catchments including the Bach, Glanfyddion Cut, Ystrad, Dwr Ial and Hesbin, have been given advice and shared best practice.   In particular, advice has focussed on the use of fertilisers, ""dirty water"" management and land spreading, as this will minimise the amount of wastewater and nutrients entering the river system, and ultimately reaching the bathing waters.","The project established in 2006 to improve water quality in the River Clwyd was also aimed at reducing the impact of industrial pollution.  Industry in the valley is relatively low-key and is mostly associated with small industrial parks.  The key concern therefore is to ensure that clean and dirty water is being disposed of correctly.   One of the larger industrial sites is the creamery at Llandyrnog, which discharges trade effluent to the nearby sewage treatment works.  The quality of the effluent is monitored using an environmental permit issued by NRW.","The project established in 2006 to improve water quality in the River Clwyd involves NRW’s officers working with private operators to minimise the impact of their discharges on water quality.  This work is continuing to address any potential pollution sources that could affect bathing waters, and involves where necessary, advisory mail drops, dye tracing, misconnection surveys and face to face meetings. 
Since 2009 work has been undertaken across a number of sub-catchments including the Bach, Glanfyddion Cut, and Ystrad, as well as the main Clwyd itself.    Visits have been made to private properties and caravan sites to ensure that sewage effluent is being disposed of correctly.   Poorly maintained private sewage treatment facilities could be a source of pollution, therefore the registration of all private sewage systems in Wales was required by 30 June 2012.   The primary aim of registration is to provide increased protection for the environment, and also sensitive features such as bathing water beaches.  Where properties are identified that are not on mains sewerage, NRW endeavours to ensure registration is made.","Seaweed (macroalgae) and phytoplankton (microscopic algae) are a natural part of the marine and freshwater environment.

It has a large tidal range and is gently sloping from low tide towards the high tide area, which is bordered by a promenade. The water quality sample point is opposite the café adjacent to the Nova Centre.","Prestatyn is located over 6 kilometres to the east of the mouth of the River Clwyd. This river drains the Vale of Clwyd from as far up as Ruthin and beyond. Within the vale, farming is of major economic importance and much of the land is used for this purpose. The vale also supports a number of towns and villages such as Rhyl, St Asaph and Denbigh. Approximately 3 kilometres to the west of the bathing water is the outfall to Rhyl Cut, which drains both urban and rural areas of Rhyl and Prestatyn. Approximately 3.5 kilometres to the east, is the mouth of Prestatyn Gutter which drains areas of Prestatyn. Approximately 600 metres to the west is a surface water outfall serving a housing development within Prestatyn.","It is the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing European standards. It is natural for water to run off the land to the sea. Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","Streams are typically affected by sewage or industrial run off from further up the catchment. Historical monitoring of the River Clwyd has shown a reduction in bacteria in recent years. Previous work has included identifying point source and diffuse pollution entering the river and its many tributaries, then carrying out work to reduce these inputs. Extra sample points around Prestatyn are also monitored.","Natural Resources Wales establishes sources of pollution around Prestatyn. Some of this work is carried out in partnership with Denbighshire County Council and Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water. Inspections are carried out by Natural Resources Wales in partnership with the local authority and the water company. These are carried out pre-season (before the 1st of May) and mid season if required (during the bathing water season).","Natural Resources Wales are currently working with Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water to identify the benefit to Rhyl bathing waters of further investment and upgrading of their assets. It is likely that any further improvements to Rhyl bathing waters will also benefit those at Prestatyn.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England and Wales since the 1980s.","Kinmel Bay Sewage Treatment Works discharges secondary treated final effluent through a 4 kilometre outfall pipe. The length of this outfall pipe was determined from modelling which predicted the discharge would not impact on nearby bathing waters. Rhuddlan Sewage Treatment Works discharges ultra violet treated effluent into the River Clwyd at Rhuddlan.","The majority of sewers in England and Wales are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","There are two significant intermittent discharges in the Rhyl area which could impact on Prestatyn bathing waters under certain tidal conditions. Westbourne Avenue Sewage Pumping Station discharges into the Clwyd Estuary approximately 7 kilometres west of Prestatyn Beach. Rhyl Coast Road Pumping Station discharges into the Rhyl Cut shortly before it outfalls on the beach 3 kilometres away from Prestatyn Beach.
There are a number of pumping station and sewer overflows located in Prestatyn which discharge to Prestatyn Gutter.","Heavy rain falling on pavements and roads often flows into surface water drains or highway drains, ending up in local rivers and, ultimately, the sea. The quality of bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.","Natural Resources Wales continues to work with Denbighshire County Council to maintain the high standard of water quality at Prestatyn. Denbighshire County Council continues to monitor the non-designated beaches on the same date as the Natural Resources Wales monitors Prestatyn EC Beach. This enables weekly data to be gathered of water quality in the wider area.","Wrongly connected wastewater pipes can affect the water quality of rivers and the sea. Misconnections have been historically resolved through partnership working between Natural Resources Wales and Denbighshire County Council. Any further suspect misconnections will be investigated as they arise.
Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.","The River Clwyd can impact on water quality at Prestatyn under certain tidal conditions. A project was set up in 2006 to improve water quality of the River Clwyd. The focus of this work has been aimed at engaging with the agricultural community to minimise the impact of diffuse pollution run-off and share best practice methods.","The River Clwyd can impact on water quality at Prestatyn under certain tidal conditions.

These are carried out pre-season (before the 1st of May) and mid-season if required (during the bathing water season).","Natural Resources Wales has developed a good working relationship with Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water and liaises regularly to identify problems that could affect bathing water quality.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England and Wales since the 1980s.","Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water have recently completed a significant investment programme and provided a main drainage system to residential properties and a school at Pontgarreg. Llangrannog Sewage Treatment Works discharges to the west side of the adjacent Llangrannog beach, below the mean low water mark. Disinfection through membrane filtration treatment of the effluent, protects the bathing water quality.","The majority of sewers in England and Wales are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","Cilborth is potentially impacted by numerous storm, emergency and surface water outfalls, both along the foreshore and within the main freshwater inputs at Llangrannog, particularly during heavy rainfall. 
Within the catchment of Cilborth and Llangrannog bathing waters, there are numerous storm, emergency and surface water outfalls that discharge to the Nant Hawen. These protect domestic properties in Llangrannog from being flooded by sewage, during heavy rainfall. Sewer overflows operating during and following periods of heavy rain, can result in a deterioration in the quality of the water in the river and at both Cilborth and Llangrannog bathing waters.
In recent years, telemetry equipment has been installed in most of the overflows by the water company. This technology has allowed Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water to respond to warnings of blockages in the sewage system and has reduced the number of actual and potential overflows.","Heavy rain falling on pavements and roads often flows into surface water drains or highway drains, ending up in local rivers and, ultimately, the sea. The quality of bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.","Natural Resources Wales and Ceredigion County Council have worked together to improve the bathing water quality at Llangrannog and Cilborth for a number of years.","Wrongly connected waste water pipes can affect the water quality of rivers and the sea. Natural Resources Wales has worked with Ceredigion County Council and Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water to trace the sources of pollution from household toilet and utility misconnections, to the private and public surface water system that discharges into Llangrannog.
Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.","Should the agricultural practices in the catchment be seen to be causing an impact on the bathing waters at Cilborth, Natural Resources Wales will endeavour to work with the farming community to reduce the risks.","Should industrial practices in the catchment be seen to be causing an impact on the bathing waters at Cilborth, Natural Resources Wales will endeavour to work with them to reduce the risks.","Natural Resources Wales continues to work with private owners to address potential pollution sources to the bathing water.

Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain.

Llandulas Sewage Pumping Station discharges to the coastal waters 3.5 kilometres west of Pensarn. This is only consented to discharge during storm events.","Heavy rain falling on pavements and roads often flows into surface water drains or highway drains, ending up in local rivers and, ultimately, the sea. The quality of bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.","Natural Resources Wales and Conwy Borough Council have been working together to monitor and maintain the bathing water quality at Pensarn for a number of years. This includes working to trace the sources of pollution from household toilet and utility misconnections to the private and public surface water system, discharging to Pensarn. Work is currently ongoing to improve the water quality of the stream opposite Hen Wrych Farm.","Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.","Farming dominates the Clwyd Valley, this includes dairying, beef and sheep. A project was set up in 2006 to improve water quality in the River Clwyd by minimising the impact of diffuse pollution run off from farms. Many farms in the main valley and the major catchment have been given advice and shared best practice. 
Advice has been given on use of fertiliser, ""dirty water"" management and land spreading. This will minimise the amount of wastewater and nutrients entering the river system.","A project was set up in 2006 to improve the water quality of the River Clwyd, including some work to reduce the impact of industrial pollution. Industry in the valley is relatively minor and is mostly associated with small industrial parks. The key concern is to ensure that clean and dirty water is being disposed of correctly. A number of industrial estates have been visited and given pollution prevention advice, in particular Tir Llwyd Enterprise Park situated inland to the rear of Kinmel Bay.","Natural Resources Wales continues to work with private owners regarding potential pollution sources to the bathing water. This work involves where necessary, advisory mail drops, dye tracing, misconnection surveys and face to face meetings. A project was set up in 2006 to improve water quality in the River Clwyd and some of this work involved working with private owners to minimise the impact of private discharges. Work is currently ongoing to investigate the water quality of the stream opposite Hen Wrych Farm.
Recent work carried out in Kinmel Bay identified a number of domestic properties where waste water pipes were wrongly connected. Natural Resources Wales and Conwy County Council worked together to rectify these misconnections.
Poorly maintained private sewage treatment facilities could be a source of pollution, therefore the registration of all private sewage systems in Wales is required by 30 June 2012. The primary aim of this exercise is to provide increased protection for the environment and sensitive features such as bathing water beaches. Where properties are identified in the catchment that are not on mains sewerage, Natural Resources Wales will endeavour to ensure registration has been made.","Seaweed (macroalgae) and phytoplankton (microscopic algae) are a natural part of the marine and freshwater environment. Below we note whether these have been recorded in quantities sufficient to be a nuisance.","This bathing water does not have a history of large amounts of seaweed (macroalgae).","Phytoplankton (microscopic algae) naturally increase in number at certain times of the year. This process is known as phytoplankton bloom. 

Algal Blooms can occur at any beach during the bathing season and are usually noticeable by a surface scum. This beach has no history of such blooms.","Conwy","2014","UKL1301      40450"
"40500","Conwy - Conwy","The bay is located approximately 2 kilometres west of the River Clwyd, within a long sandy stretch of beach, which extends over 8 kilometres, from Kinmel Bay to Llanddulas. The beach has a large tidal range and is gently sloping from the low tide mark to the high tide pebbled area. The water quality sample point lies to the east of the Golden Sands Holiday Camp.","The natural drainage (hydrological) catchment surrounding the bathing water is primarily man-made and is pumped away from the Kinmel Bay area to the Clwyd Estuary. This enters the bathing waters to the west of Rhyl. Two small streams drain the Abergele area, entering the bathing waters approximately 3.5 km to the west of Sandy Cove.","It is the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing European standards. It is natural for water to run off the land to the sea. Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","Streams are typically affected by sewage or industrial run off from further up the catchment. Monitoring of Abergele streams has shown low levels of bacteria to be present. The streams drain the town of Abergele as well as rural areas around the town. Natural Resources Wales will continue to respond to any reports of pollution entering the catchments served by these streams.
The River Clwyd and Abergele stream do not normally impact on Sandy Cove water quality.","Natural Resources Wales works to establish sources of pollution around Sandy Cove. Some of this work is carried out in partnership with Conwy Borough Council
and Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water. Inspections are carried out by Natural Resources Wales in partnership with the local authority and the water company. These are carried out pre-season (before the 1st of May) and mid season if required (during the bathing water season).","Kinmel Bay Sewage Treatment Works discharges secondary treated final effluent through a 4 kilometre outfall pipe. The length of this outfall pipe was determined using modelling equipment, which predicted the discharge should not impact water quality near to the bathing water.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England and Wales since the 1980s.",,"The majority of sewers in England and Wales are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","There are two intermittent discharges into coastal waters around Kinmel Bay.
