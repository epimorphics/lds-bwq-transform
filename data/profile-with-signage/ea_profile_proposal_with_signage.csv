"03600","Northumberland","Northumberland","Spittal Beach is a gently sloping resort beach approximately one kilometre long situated immediately south of the mouth of the River Tweed.","The River Tweed rises over 100km to the west and drains a catchment of approx 4000 sq km. The lower part of the catchment which influences bathing water quality is predominantly devoted to arable and livestock farming. The historic town of Berwick-upon-Tweed and its satellites, Spittal and Tweedmouth, lie at the mouth of the estuary.","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing higher standards. It is natural for water to run off the land to the sea. Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","The Tweed Estuary discharges to the sea at the north end of the bathing water. Diffuse run off from agricultural land and upstream settlements affects the bacteriological quality of the river. After heavy rain, this can have a short-term impact on bathing water quality.  High river flows also shorten residence times in the estuary, exacerbating the impact of discharges from the sewerage system in and around Berwick.","The Environment Agency's investigations have been aimed at identifying non water company sources of pollution that may be affecting the bathing water so that we can implement measures to address them.  We believe that agricultural sources in the Tweed catchment may be significant, particularly in wet weather, although we have not found evidence pointing to any particularly important source.","Since 1995, the Environment Agency have worked closely with Northumbrian Water to identify and deliver significant investment in the sewage infrastructure around this bathing water.  Most recently, an investigation by Northumbrian water into the effects of their systems on bathing water quality has led to improvements at 2 CSOs.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","Sewage from Berwick, Spittal and Tweedmouth is treated at a sewage works that discharges to the Tweed estuary to the west of the town.","The majority of sewers in England are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","A combined sewer overflow (CSO) which could discharge onto the beach during heavy rainfall was removed in early 2012.  Other CSOs discharge to the estuary and contribute to pollution at the bathing water when river flows are high during wet weather.","Heavy rain falling on pavements and roads often flows into surface water drains or highway drains, ending up in local rivers and ultimately the sea. The quality of bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.",,"Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.","The catchment of the River Tweed is largely agricultural with a mixture of arable and livestock farming. During and after periods of heavy rainfall, runoff from agricultural areas will be greatly increased. The quality of the bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.  The limited data collected on sources of bacteria suggests that livestock may be a significant source, particularly when river flows are high. We have engaged with the local farming community but livestock numbers in the local catchment are low suggesting a more diffuse contribution from a wider catchment.",,,"Seaweed (macroalgae) and phytoplankton (microscopic algae) are a natural part of the marine and freshwater environment.

Short term pollution is caused when heavy rainfall washes faecal material into the sea from livestock, sewage and urban drainage via rivers and streams.  At this site the risk of encountering reduced water quality increases after rainfall and typically returns to normal after 1-3 days. The Environment Agency makes daily pollution risk forecasts based on rainfall patterns and will issue a pollution risk warning if heavy rainfall occurs to enable bathers to avoid periods of increased risk. 
The Environment Agency works to reduce the sources of this pollution through pollution prevention measures, work with agriculture and water companies.
13 warnings advising against swimming due to an increase risk of short term pollution were issued in 2016 for Spittal bathing water. These warnings were issued because of the effects of heavy rain on the water quality.","Environment Agency samplers make observations of litter present on the beach at every visit, this includes assessments of sewage debris, litter and tar.

Whitby Harbour lies to the east of the bathing water area.","An area of 360 square kilometres (known as the hydrological catchment) drains into the bathing water. The catchment includes the River Esk which is approximately 42 kilometres in length and originates from the steep valleys near Danby. The river flows eastwards and passes through several villages including Grosmont and Ruswarp. It finally drains into the North Sea via Whitby Harbour. 
The bedrock is largely made up of limestone embedded with areas of sandstone. The upper Whitby catchment has steep valleys which collect surface water from a large expanse of rural land. As a result, the catchment has a fast response to rainfall which affects watercourses and subsequently the beach very quickly. The main land use in the catchment is managed grassland, moorland and livestock farming and the urbanisation of Whitby town.","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing higher standards.

There are two watercourses within the Filey beach surface water catchment; Church Ravine Beck to the north and Martins Ravine Beck to the south. Parts of the watercourses are culverted. A culvert takes the water underground in urbanised areas. 
The catchment is largely made up of the town with arable farmlands in the surrounding areas. As a result, surface water runs off the land and enters the streams and the beach very quickly.","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing higher standards.

Urban and agricultural pollutants in the surface water runoff are washed down into the streams and the bathing beach. 
Martins Ravine Beck discharges to the bathing water area via a short sea outfall south of the bathing water monitoring point. 

Church Ravine Beck discharges into the sea via a short sea outfall north of the bathing water monitoring point. Part of the beck is culverted (runs underground). During and following heavy rainfall, the surface water is diverted away from the outfall by a large flap valve in the sea wall and discharges directly onto the beach. This may sometimes result in reduced water quality.","The Environment Agency regularly carry out investigations to identify sources of pollution in the catchment.

Yorkshire Water designed a new scheme to reduce the amount of storm effluent being discharged into the bathing water and the North Sea.  There is one emergency overflow that discharges effluent into the bathing water.  There is also a new long-sea outfall that intercepts storm effluents which previously discharged into the Gypsey Race.  The scheme including the connection and operation of the new long-sea outfall was completed in December 2014  and it should improve bathing water quality at Bridlington North and South Bays.  There are two further storm overflows in the North Bay, when these outfalls are operating they discharge diluted and screened effluent into the North Sea.  While the operation of these outfalls can still result in a decline in the bathing water quality, the impacts are likely to be much less compared to previous years.

Storm overflows may operate during and after heavy rainfall when the sewer system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water entering it. The overflows prevent sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties.
There are two outfalls within the bathing water area at Withernsea; an emergency overflow within close proximity to the bathing water monitoring point and a storm overflow at the southern end of the bathing water area. The operation of this storm overflow may sometimes result in reduced bathing water quality. The emergency overflow next to the bathing water monitoring point has been designed to operate only under severe weather conditions or when there are problems sewerage network system.

Previously, marine modelling to assess water movement and impacts on quality showed no clear source of contamination. Recent investigation work has been continuing with Anglian Water as part of their investment programme. Studies of the two main sea outfalls, Clacton (Holland Haven) and Jaywick were undertaken during 2009 and 2010. The results of the surveys indicated that only the Holland outfall could have an impact on the bathing water. Disinfection of the Clacton Holland outfall was carried out in 2011 to investigate this further, and results showed there may be other major sources of contamination affecting this bathing water. The foul and surface sewerage network near to the beach was extensively examined using CCTV during 2009/10 and this identified no unknown sources of pollution from the local sewerage network. Monitoring in 2011 revealed 'hotspots' of poor water quality close to the bathing water and these were investigated during 2012 in partnership with the water company, local businesses and the local authority.  Investigations continued through the 2012 season and confirmed very localised contamination near the pier.  As the pier drainage system appeared to be intact other sources were considered.  Attention was drawn to the large resident population of pigeons that roosted under the pier.  Examination of the sand under the pier, especially early in the morning when the tide had been out overnight, showed significant deposits of pigeon faeces.  As part of the investigations, dye was placed on the sand ahead of a rising tide to mimic the movement of the pigeon faecal contamination.  This dye stayed close to the surf line and appeared to concentrate as it flowed past the designated sample point.  This work suggested that the roosting pigeons may be having a significant impact upon water quality.  Following management of pigeon numbers, water quality improved greatly in 2013 especially during the first half of the season.  Investigational sampling continued in 2014 with data from that year showing a very similar picture to 2013, being better than 2012.  A similar pattern to most previous years was again evident whereby the water quality was worse in July & August, the holiday season.  This suggests the principle cause is related to sewage but there remains an issue with pigeons.  Further investigations will concentrate on the privately owned sewerage systems serving the promenade and pier. Investigations in 2015 included CCTV work on the nearby private & public sewers, extensive sampling of the sewerage networks and beach along with additional sampling of the sea. Nothing to identify the source of the pollution was found.  It is now generally thought that pigeons are only a minor source of the contamination.  A bird deterrent was installed on the pier as have cameras to monitor the tide and beach usage and will be operational again in 2017.  An intensive water sampling programme was undertaken in August 2016.  Significant levels of contamination was found near the pier especially at periods near low water.  Samples of water taken from about 2m below the beach surface were also found to be contaminated.  There is now evidence that the contamination could be contained within the groundwater.  This theory will be investigated further in 2017.","Previously, the bathing waters on the Tendring Peninsula were heavily influenced by a number of sea outfalls.

It is a small sand and mud beach, approximately 300 metres wide, at the mouth of the Rock Lea River.","The catchment surrounding Poole Harbour Rockley Sands is approximately 86,500 hectares and includes the rivers Piddle, Frome, Corfe, and Sherford. These rivers drain from the Dorset Downs and flow into Poole Harbour which is one of the largest and shallowest natural harbours in the world. 
The Piddle and Frome are approximately 30 kilometres (km) and 43km long respectively and flow to Wareham, where they both enter Poole Harbour via Wareham Channel. The River Corfe is approximately 11km long (including tributaries) and flows parallel to the Purbeck ridge to Corfe Castle. It is joined by a number of streams before entering the harbour through the Wych Channel. The River Sherford is approximately 12km long and flows from Bere Regis in the Wareham Forest to Lytchett Bay on the northern side of Poole Harbour. 
The steep slopes at the top of the catchment mean rain runs off rapidly into the rivers. Further down the catchment the valleys broaden and there is a more gradual response to rainfall runoff. The majority of the land in the catchment is agricultural with mixed livestock and arable.

There is a stream approximately two and a half kilometres long that flows from the east through farmland before entering the estuary at the beach 400m south of the Environment Agency monitoring point. 
The River Torridge is 77km long and rises on a gently rolling plateau at Baxworthy Cross near Hartland. The river falls steeply to the estuary at Bideford. The River Okement, a major tributary of the Torridge, also rises on Dartmoor. The upper estuary is narrow, meandering and muddy, and joins the River Taw from the east at Appledore Pool forming a broader joint estuary. 
The River Taw rises at Taw Head within Dartmoor National Park and is fed by three major tributaries: the River Yeo (Lapford), the River Mole and the Little Dart River. The Taw flows north through scenic valleys before joining the estuary at Newbridge above Barnstaple. The steep catchment means rain runs off rapidly into the rivers and estuary.
Most of the catchment is rural and sparsely populated. The main urban areas are around the Taw Estuary at Barnstaple, Braunton, Bickington, Fremington and Yelland. Agriculture is the primary industry, and this is mostly dairy and livestock farming. Tourism and recreation are the major industries around the estuary and coast. Other industries include quarrying for sandstone, light industry, timber processing, fish farming and the generation of hydroelectric power.","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing higher standards.

The Environment Agency have used a DNA tracing technique to help us identify whether sources of faecal pollution are human or animal. Results showed that the majority is from agricultural sources, although there is a small component of human sewage in the system. The Environment Agency believe that diffuse agricultural pollution throughout the catchment puts the bathing water quality at risk particularly after heavy rain. 
The Environment Agency have been working with South West Water to carry out a review of sewerage performance within the Taw/Torridge area.

Under certain conditions the Taw/Torridge Estuary can also affect water quality at the bathing water.",,"In the past this bathing water was affected by continuous and intermittent discharges of sewage to the Taw/Torridge Estuary. The South West Water sewage treatment scheme for the area collects sewage from the various settlements around the Taw/Torridge Estuary. It is split into two schemes centred on the Ashford (Barnstaple) sewage treatment works (STW) (North Scheme), and a works at Cornborough (South Scheme). 
The North Scheme at Ashford (Barnstaple) STW, which provided secondary treatment and an outfall to the deep water channel of the Taw Estuary, was completed during 1996 and 1997. The STW was upgraded with ultraviolet (UV) disinfection in October 1997, and flows from the Velator STW were transferred to Ashford at that time. 
The South Scheme at Cornborough STW, which provides secondary treatment and UV disinfection, was completed in 2003. The scheme included the transfer of sewage from the Rock Nose discharge and other continuous discharges from the south bank of the Taw Estuary to Cornborough STW, and discharge though a 600m outfall at Abbotsham. 
A number of local sewerage systems with combined sewer overflows (CSO) in Bideford, Appledore, Velator, Fremington and parts of south Barnstaple were also improved or removed as part of the scheme. Improvements were made to eight storm overflows including Yelland CSO, Bideford pumping station (PS), and Instow 'A' PS in April 2004, and a further 22 storm overflows were improved by April 2005. Storm overflow event duration monitoring (EDM) was installed at eleven South West Water assets by April 2011. 
Further EDM installations and work to reduce the frequency of discharges from 14 CSOs to the Taw/Torridge Estuary are due for completion by April 2019.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","Sewage from Saunton, Braunton, Barnstaple and the surrounding area, is treated at Ashford (Barnstaple) STW and discharges to the Taw Estuary, 13km southeast of the bathing water.
Sewage from Instow, Bideford, and the surrounding area, is treated at Cornborough STW and then discharges to the sea at Rock Nose, eight kilometres south of the bathing water.
Both of these discharges are disinfected, and designed to protect bathing water quality.","The majority of sewers in England are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water.

The catchment consists of the Par River and tributaries, including Tywardreath Stream, Bokiddick Brook, Carbis Stream and Treverbyn Stream. The Par River rises near the A30 then flows for approximately 14.5km before reaching the sea. The upper half of the catchment follows fairly level ground, then quickly drops after it enters the steep sided Luxulyan. 
Much of the remainder of the river flows within wide flood plains. In the past the Par River has been affected by the China clay industry. The combined effects of clay mining, cross catchment transfers and the porous nature of the catchment, have reduced runoff from the steep gradient of the Par River resulting in reduced peak flows to the bathing water. 
A second smaller stream known as the Polmear Stream enters the sea at the eastern end of the beach approximately 220 metres (m) from the Environment Agency monitoring point. The catchment is mostly agricultural, with more than 50 farms.

A sewage treatment works (STW) for Par at Merthen Farm (north of Crinnis) was built by South West Water in 1992 and commissioned in 1993. The scheme included the collection of sewage from Par, Charlestown, Duporth, Porthpean and part of the St Austell catchment, and transfer via a tunnel sewer to Par STW where it receives secondary treatment before being discharged through a 1.3 kilometre (km) sea outfall south of Fishing Point in St Austell Bay.

We are working with Cornwall County Council and South West Water to identify and rectify any problems when they arise.
Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.","There are farms in the River Par catchment, which are used for dairy and beef livestock.

The streams are channelled underground in many places, especially where they flow through St Austell and Carlyon Bay. 
Land use is split between agricultural land and urban/mining land. Urban areas include St Austell, Carlyon Bay and part of St Blazey. The Eden Project is in the northeast of the catchment.

These have since been resolved.","The need for sewage treatment around the northern part of St Austell Bay was identified to protect the bathing waters at Polkerris, Par, Shorthorn, Crinnis, Charlestown, Duporth and Porthpean. 
The South West Water sewage treatment scheme for Polkerris, which provides fine screening, was completed in 2003.
A sewage treatment works (STW) for Par at Merthen Farm (north of Crinnis) was built by South West Water in 1992 and commissioned in 1993. The scheme included the collection of sewage from Par, Charlestown, Duporth, Porthpean and part of the St Austell catchment, and transfer via a tunnel sewer to Par STW where it receives secondary treatment before being discharged through a 1.3 kilometre (km) sea outfall south of Fishing Point in St Austell Bay. 
The scheme also included extensive resewerage and removal of various untreated discharges and a primary treated effluent discharge at Par Spit. The storm tank at Par STW and Harbour Road (No.2) pumping station storm overflow were improved by April 2006. 
The sewage treatment scheme for St Austell North (Luxulyan), which provides secondary treatment and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection, was completed in early 2006. Improvements to the storm discharge from St Austell North STW were also made at that time.

We are working with Cornwall County Council and South West Water to identify and rectify any problems when they arise.
Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain.

"21600","East Devon","East Devon","Seaton is a resort town in Lyme Bay on the south coast of Devon. It is a shingle beach approximately one kilometre wide, and the River Axe Estuary enters the sea through a small harbour at the eastern end of the bathing water.","The catchment surrounding Seaton is approximately 40,300 hectares. The River Axe is 35 kilometres long and rises near Beaminster in Dorset. It is joined by the Yarty and Coly tributaries and becomes tidal three kilometres inland at Colyford. The porous nature of the geology beneath the River Axe catchment causes the river to respond relatively slowly to rainfall compared with other rivers in East Devon. The Axe Estuary is a bar-built estuary containing extensive mudflats, saltmarsh and reed beds. At low tide, islands are formed across the intertidal mudflats, isolated by a narrow channel. The estuary enters the sea at Axmouth near Seaton. 
The catchment is known for its valuable visual landscape and includes parts of the Blackdown Hills, East Devon and Dorset Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs). There are also four Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), one Special Protection Area (SPA), 29 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI's), and 118 Scheduled Monuments. The catchment is mostly agricultural, with more than 50 farms.","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing higher standards. It is natural for water to run off the land to the sea. Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","Streams and rivers are typically affected by human sewage, animal slurry and runoff from roads. Seaton is close to the estuary of the River Axe which can affect bathing water quality after heavy rainfall.

The South West Water sewage treatment scheme for Seaton, which provides secondary treatment and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection, was completed in 2002. Storm tanks and screens were installed at the STW in April 2003, and work to reduce the frequency of storm spills at Axmouth pumping station was also carried out at that time. CSO event duration monitoring was installed at Seaton STW, Axmouth and Harbour Road pumping stations in April 2011.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","The Seaton STW outfall discharges to the River Axe Estuary two and a half kilometres from the bathing water.

It is a large sandy beach resort, approximately 1.8 kilometres wide, backed by the promenade and town.","Exmouth bathing water is affected by the catchment surrounding the Littleham Brook, which is approximately 600 hectares, and also by the enormous Exe Estuary catchment which is approximately 150,000 hectares. The Littleham Brook is four and a half kilometres long and flows southwest from Littleham Village through Green Farm and Maer Farm to Maer Bridge where it is piped under the beach to the sea at Maer Rocks. The steep catchment means rain runs off rapidly into the stream.
The Exe catchment extends from the moorland of Exmoor National Park at the source of the River Exe, to the Exe Estuary at Exmouth. The main tributaries of the River Exe are the rivers Culm, Barle, Clyst and Creedy. The Exe and Barle rise in the wet open moorland of Exmoor, before flowing through steep-sided valleys with extensive broad-leaved woodlands. The River Barle flows from northern Exmoor, to join the River Exe at Exebridge. The River Culm rises in the Blackdown Hills and flows through the Culm Valley to join the River Exe at Exeter. The River Creedy is a small river which merges with the River Yeo at Crediton and meets the River Exe at Cowley Bridge. The River Clyst rises near Cullompton, and flows through the Clyst Valley to join the Exe Estuary near Exeter.

It is a sandy beach resort, approximately one kilometre wide, with a pier, backed by the promenade and the town.","The catchment surrounding Teignmouth is approximately 52,600 hectares. The Brimley Brook is approximately 1.8km long and is mostly channelled underground as it flows through Teignmouth. About half way down it’s length the brook splits into two branches and one arm enters the sea to the northeast of the bathing water. The Teign Estuary discharges approximately half a kilometre to the south of the bathing water. The 42km long River Teign rises on North Dartmoor and its main tributaries are the Aller Brook and rivers Lemon and Bovey. The Aller Brook sub catchment is the most populated. 
In the lower reaches of the Teign the floodplain is wide and gently sloping. At Newton Abbot the Teign enters a long narrow estuary which is the most easterly of Devon’s drowned river valleys (rias).

Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","Streams and rivers are typically affected by human sewage, animal slurry and runoff from roads. The River Teign may affect bathing water quality but is not the main factor. One arm of the Brimley Brook discharges to the northeast of the beach. In the past it has been contaminated by wrongly connected domestic waste water pipes from which it remains vulnerable. There is also a potential for the Brimley Brook to affect the bathing water at certain states of the tide.","The Environment Agency have carried out extensive investigations.  The most recent investigation concluded that a combined sewer overflow (CSO), birds roosting on the Teignmouth Pier, and polluted rainwater runoff from across the town, all affect bathing water quality in roughly equal proportions. Teignmouth Town bathing water is next to Teignmouth Pier. Birds roost on and under the pier and their faeces can affect bathing water quality. Some parts of the beach are also used by dog walkers. The Environment Agency continues to work with Teignbridge District Council to quantify the effects of these pollution sources, and consider how the impacts may be reduced.","The South West Water sewage treatment scheme for Teignmouth was identified for the protection of Teignmouth and Shaldon bathing waters. The scheme was completed at the end of 2000 and collects sewage from Newton Abbot, the Aller Valley, Milber, Combeinteignhead, Shaldon, Teignmouth, Bishopsteignton and Kingsteignton. Sewage receives secondary treatment and is discharged through a two kilometre long sea outfall. 
Stokeinteignhead was connected to the Teignmouth sewerage system in 2003. Improvements to 24 combined sewer overflows (CSO) in the Teign Estuary including 14 in Newton Abbot and 10 in Teignmouth were completed by the end of March 2004. A further 18 CSOs including 12 in Newton Abbot and six in Teignmouth were improved by the end of March 2005. 
Storm overflow event duration monitoring (EDM) was installed at the Railway Station CSO by April 2011, and further work to reduce the frequency of discharges from this CSO was completed by May 2015.

The Environment Agency have regularly inspected and sampled surface water outfalls, and have worked with the District Council to label surface drains onto the beach so that potential pollution sources can be tracked back to their source and appropriate actions taken. In 2015 the District Council, with support from the Environment Agency, installed Bird Free gel to  the underside the pier to deter pigeons from roosting. 
There is an active 'Love Your Beach' community group in Teignmouth. Through community engagement events and local media the group encourage the public to take action to improve water quality. Members of the group include representatives from the District Council, Town Council, the Harbour Commission, South West Water and the Environment Agency.","Wrongly connected domestic waste water pipes can also affect the bathing water quality. We have checked the local sewerage system for misconnections and have worked with Teignbridge District Council Environmental Health department to resolve any problems. We have also worked with the District Council, South West Water and the private owner of Teignmouth Pier to collect all surface drainage from the pier and convey it to the foul sewerage system. These works were completed shortly before the start of the 2012 bathing season.
Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.","There are more than 20 farms in the Teign catchment.

It is fed by surface water sewers, highway drains, and land drainage before it discharges through an outfall at the beach. Land use is mostly urban. The steep catchment means rain runs off rapidly into the stream.","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing higher standards.

It is a sandy beach resort, approximately 180 metres wide, backed by cliffs. A stream flows across the beach to the sea.","The catchment surrounding Salcombe South Sands is approximately 8,800 hectares. The Combe Stream is approximately two and a half kilometres long and descends to the Salcombe Kingsbridge Estuary at the beach from the village of Malborough. The estuary is unusual because it has no large river feeding it, just a series of small streams rising from springs at Frogmore, Bowcombe, Batson, East Allington, Sherford and other surrounding villages. 
The estuary is tidal to Kingsbridge, and like the other estuaries of South Devon, the original deep river valley has been flooded by sea level rise, to create a wide expanse of water with secluded creeks and side arms. Woodland fringes come down to the high tide line, and the areas of saltmarsh or grazing marsh are quite restricted. Kingsbridge and Salcombe are the main urban areas and land use is rural.
Land use in the local area surrounding the bathing water is a combination of urban and rural, with just one or two farms.","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing higher standards.

The Lyhner rises on Bodmin Moor and flows for approximately 34km to the estuary at Plymouth. The Tiddy joins the Lyhner in the upper estuary. 
The River Tavy rises in Dartmoor National Park and falls steeply for 28km to the tidal limit at Lopwell, before joining the Tamar Estuary 10km upstream from Plymouth Sound. The River Plym rises on the open moorland of south Dartmoor and becomes tidal five and a half kilometres before entering the sea at the eastern side of Plymouth Sound.

The River Looe has two main branches, the East and the West Looe rivers, which drain from the southern slopes of Bodmin Moor to the coast. The eastern branch is approximately 16 kilometres (km) long. It starts near St Cleer and flows south, passing close to the western outskirts of Liskeard. The western branch is approximately 14km long and starts near Dobwalls. 
There are many tributaries which flow to meet these main branches which increases the length of stream in the catchment significantly. The lower reaches of the two rivers form the Looe Estuary and come together as they flow through the town. From the headwaters to the estuary, both rivers fall steeply and are subject to rapid changes in water levels after periods of rainfall. 
It is a rural area, ranging from open moorland to rolling hills with steep-sided river valleys running across them In the past there was extensive mining activity in the north of the catchment, which has left a legacy of abandoned mines and workings. 
There are mostly grassland fields in the upper reaches of the catchment giving way to more arable land in the south of the catchment. The steep river valleys are often heavily wooded.

"27100","Cornwall","Cornwall","Readymoney is at the mouth of the Fowey Estuary on the south coast of Cornwall. It is a remote sandy cove, approximately 70 metres wide, sheltered by tall cliffs.","The catchment surrounding Readymoney is approximately 27,600 hectares. The River Fowey catchment includes the Colliford and Siblyback Reservoirs, which supply water to a large part of Cornwall. The River Fowey rises on Bodmin Moor and flows south for 35 kilometres (km) before reaching the tidal limit at Lostwithiel. The estuary continues for a further nine kilometres before reaching the coast at Fowey. There are several tributaries that enter the Fowey Estuary, the largest of which is the River Lerryn. 
The area is rural, ranging from open moorland to rolling hills intersected by steep-sided river valleys. In the past there was extensive mining activity, especially in the north of the catchment, which has left a legacy of abandoned mines and workings. 
Land use is mostly agricultural, with more than 50 farms. In the northern moorland part of the catchment it is mostly acid and improved grassland with pockets of arable land further south. Urban areas include Fowey, Lostwithiel, Lerryn and a number of moorland villages. There are a number of Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI’s) within the catchment mostly on Bodmin Moor and along the coast. The catchment is partly within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing higher standards. It is natural for water to run off the land to the sea. Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","Streams and rivers are typically affected by human sewage, animal slurry and runoff from roads. Readymoney beach is next to the River Fowey Estuary where water quality is temporarily worse during and after heavy rainfall, particularly at low tide. The Readymoney Stream flows onto this beach, and can also affect water quality after heavy rainfall.","In 2010, the Environment Agency carried out additional catchment monitoring in the Readymoney Stream alongside the Environment Agency routine bathing water monitoring. The Environment Agency used a DNA tracing technique to help identify whether sources of faecal pollution were animal or human with surveys carried out in wet and dry weather conditions. The aim of this work was to pinpoint pollution problems and improve water quality at the bathing water. Investigations suggested that faecal pollution originated both from sewerage and drainage issues in Fowey and from diffuse and point source agricultural runoff from surrounding farms in wet weather.","The South West Water sewage treatment scheme for Fowey, which provides secondary treatment, was completed in 1996. The scheme also included some resewerage and improvements to combined sewer overflows. Fowey STW was upgraded with ultraviolet (UV) disinfection in 2002, and storm overflows at Caffa Mill pumping station (PS), Polruan PS, Whitehouse Point, Readymoney Road and Readymoney SPS were improved in 2003. The intermittent discharge at Town Quay was improved in 2004. 
Between 2011 and 2013 a number of actions were undertaken by South West Water to improve water quality in the River Fowey and Fowey Estuary.  Improvements included sewer re-habilitation in Fowey to stop saline infiltration, surface water separation in Golant, UV disinfection of discharges from Golant STW and Lostwithiel STW, and a large new storm tank for Lostwithiel pumping station. Storm overflow event duration monitoring (EDM) was installed at seven intermittent discharges in Fowey by December 2011, and at Caffa Mill CSO by April 2016.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","The outfall from Fowey STW discharges one and a half kilometres northeast of the bathing water. This discharge is disinfected and designed to protect bathing water quality.","The majority of sewers in England are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","There is an emergency/storm overflow from the pumping station at Readymoney Cove, that discharges 100m from Readymoney beach. There are also other emergency/storm overflows that discharge to the River Fowey Estuary in the Fowey/Polruan and Readymoney areas. The operation of the overflows can lead to a temporary drop in bathing water quality.","Heavy rain falling on pavements and roads often flows into surface water drains or highway drains, ending up in local rivers and ultimately the sea. The quality of bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.","The urban area of Fowey immediately behind the beach is served by a combined (surface and sewer) system.","Wrongly connected domestic waste water pipes can also affect the bathing water quality. We have checked the local sewerage system for misconnections. We are working with Cornwall County Council and South West Water to identify and rectify any problems when they arise.
Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.","There are more than 50 farms in the catchment, most of which are used for livestock. During and after periods of heavy rainfall, runoff to the River Fowey from agricultural land is greatly increased, and the quality of the bathing water can be reduced. In recent years Environment Agency officers have been working with farmers in the catchment to reduce this impact.",,"There is a private discharge located near the bathing water. The Environment Agency do not believe this is a source of pollution to the bathing water.

It is a small, remote sandy bay, approximately 170 metres wide, surrounded by cliffs.","The catchment surrounding Polkerris is approximately 7,200 hectares. There are no streams flowing directly onto the beach. The catchment includes the Par River and tributaries, including Tywardreath Stream, Bokiddick Brook, Carbis Stream and Treverbyn Stream. The Par River rises near the A30 then flows for approximately 14.5km before reaching the sea. The upper half of the catchment follows fairly level ground, then quickly drops after it enters the steep sided Luxulyan. 
Much of the remainder of the river flows within wide flood plains. In the past the Par River has been affected by the China clay industry. The combined effects of clay mining, cross catchment transfers and the porous nature of the catchment, have reduced runoff from the steep gradient of the Par River resulting in reduced peak flows to the bathing water. 
The catchment is mostly agricultural, with more than 50 farms. The rural areas are dominated by improved grassland with smaller areas of arable, woodland and a significant area where china clay mining dominates the landscape. Urban areas include Par, Tywardreath, Luxulyan, Roche, and the small fishing village of Polkerris is behind the beach.

The South West Water sewage treatment scheme for Polkerris, which provides fine screening, was completed in 2003.
A sewage treatment works (STW) for Par at Merthen Farm (north of Crinnis) was built by South West Water in 1992 and commissioned in 1993. The scheme included the collection of sewage from Par, Charlestown, Duporth, Porthpean and part of the St Austell catchment, and transfer via a tunnel sewer to Par STW where it receives secondary treatment before being discharged through a 1.3 kilometre (km) sea outfall south of Fishing Point in St Austell Bay. 
The scheme also included extensive resewerage and removal of various untreated discharges and a primary treated effluent discharge at Par Spit. The storm tank at Par STW and Harbour Road (No-2) pumping station storm overflow were improved by April 2006. 
The sewage treatment scheme for St Austell North (Luxulyan), which provides secondary treatment and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection, was completed in early 2006.

The Red River enters St Ives Bay approximately 280m north of the Environment Agency monitoring point at Godrevy, and the Hayle Estuary system is approximately three kilometres (km) to the south. The Red River is approximately 13km (35km long including major tributaries) and rises from springs near Bolenowe. The steep catchment means rain runs off rapidly into the river.
In the past the Red River has been affected by the mining industry at Tuckingmill, Pool, Redruth, and Camborne. Land use in the rural areas is mostly arable near the coast and improved grassland with some dairy farming on the higher ground. Much of the coast in this part of Cornwall has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing higher standards.

The Red River flows onto this beach. The Environment Agency have monitored the river since 1986 and found that water quality is temporarily worse during and after heavy rainfall. There can also be water discolouration issues related to the resuspension of ochre from minewater.","The Environment Agency has carried out additional monitoring of the Red River and is working with South West Water and other partners to improve knowledge of the impact of combined sewer overflow discharges on the Red River. Recent studies have suggested that during times of extreme wet weather there are impacts throughout the whole Red River catchment from agriculture as well as urban drainage.","The sewage treatment scheme for Penzance and St Ives was completed by South West Water in early 1995. The scheme included extensive sewerage, improvements to intermittent discharges and the removal of untreated sewage discharges. Wastewater from St Ives is pumped to Hayle sewage treatment works (STW), where it receives secondary treatment before its discharge through a 2.7km long sea outfall west of Godrevy Head. The Hayle STW was enlarged and upgraded in 1995 and again in 2000. 
Improvements were made to the Knave-Go-By combined sewer overflow (CSO) in the Red River catchment in 1999, as part of the Camborne and Redruth sewage treatment scheme. This scheme was completed by December 2001, and included improvements to the Reskadinnick CSO.
Storm overflow event duration monitoring (EDM) was installed at the Reskadinnick pumping station by April 2011, and at the Tolvaddon pumping station by February 2013.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","Sewage from Hayle is pumped to Hayle STW for treatment, and discharges to the sea 2.3km from the bathing water. Sewage from Camborne is treated at Camborne STW and discharged to the sea at North Cliffs, five and a half kilometres from the bathing water. These discharges are designed to protect bathing water quality.
The Gwithian Churchtown STW, which includes tertiary treatment by reed bed, discharges to a tributary of the Red River, 1.2km from the bathing area.","The majority of sewers in England are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water.

It is a sand and mud beach resort, approximately 2.2 kilometres wide and backed by a sea defence wall. The beach has a shallow slope and a very large tidal range (11 metres). At low tide, the sea lies up to half a kilometre from the beach, inaccesible on foot due to the dangerous intertidal mudflats. The rivers Brue and Parrett both flow into the Bay just south of the bathing water. Bridgwater Bay is a National Nature Reserve; an important habitat for wading birds and many rare insects.","The catchment surrounding Burnham Jetty North is approximately 222,000 hectares. The Parrett, Huntspill and Brue rivers flow from the steep uplands of the Quantocks, Blackdown Hills and Mendips. The rivers flow north and west into the extensive low-lying floodplain of the Somerset Levels and Moors through various man-made drainage channels to the Severn Estuary at Bridgwater Bay. The steep catchment means rain runs off rapidly into the rivers. Rivers and other streams in the Somerset Levels are controlled by sluices which manage the volume of freshwater entering Bridgwater Bay
The River Parrett is 60km long and flows through Dorset and Somerset to its mouth at Burnham-on-Sea. The main tributaries of the Parrett are the rivers Isle, Tone, Yeo and Cary. The Tone joins the tidal Parrett 30km inland at Burrowbridge. The River Cary rises at Castle Cary and flows west into the man-made King’s Sedgemoor Drain at Henley Corner. It continues across the Somerset Moors and joins the tidal River Parrett downstream of Bridgwater at Dunball Sluice. 
The River Huntspill is a man-made river in the Sedgemoor district of the Somerset Levels that joins the River Parrett just south of Highbridge. The river was built to act as a long reservoir to provide an all year-round supply of water for the Royal Ordnance Factory near Puriton, as well as to help drain parts of the lower Brue Valley. 
The River Brue rises in Somerset and falls quickly in a narrow valley to a point just beyond Bruton where it is joined by the River Pitt. To the northeast of Glastonbury, the Brue is joined by various man-made drainage channels before entering the Bristol Channel. 
The catchment is mostly rural, with urban areas making up only five per cent of the total. The majority of the land is used for large scale agriculture, with more than 1000 farms.","It is the Environment Agency role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing higher standards.

During and after periods of heavy rainfall, runoff from agricultural and urban areas is greatly increased, and the quality of the rivers and the bathing water may be reduced.","The Environment Agency has carried out additional monitoring in the River Brue since 2007, alongside the routine bathing water monitoring. In 2008, the Environment Agency investigated levels of faecal pollution along the beach. This survey suggested that the water quality was worse at the southern end of the beach where the Parrett and Brue river enter the bay. In 2008 the Environment Agency also sampled the lower part of the River Parrett, its tributaries and other water outfalls, sewage treatment works and continued to monitor the River Brue. This work helped to target further investigations, locate pollution problems and improve the bathing water quality. Between 2009 and 2012, the Environment Agency carried out additional monitoring on the Brue and Parrett rivers. DNA analysis of these samples suggested that waste from both humans and animals are impacting water quality at the bathing water. The Environment Agency has continued to investigate watercourses suffering from faecal pollution.","In the past this bathing water was affected by discharges from West Huntspill sewage treatment works (STW) and Bridgwater STW. The Wessex Water sewage treatment scheme for West Huntspill, which provides secondary treatment, was partially completed in 1997. Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection was added in 2000. The Wessex Water sewage treatment scheme for Bridgwater, which provides secondary treatment and UV disinfection, was also completed in 2000. 
Improvements were made to the storm overflows at three pumping stations in Bridgwater by the end of 2002, and the storage capacity of the Highbridge storm tanks was increased in 2004 to reduce discharge frequency and volume. Improvements were made to eight storm overflows in Bridgwater and a storm overflow in Burnham in 2005. 
The Environment Agency has been working with Wessex Water to review sewerage performance within the catchment area. Wessex Water added ultra-violet (UV) treatment to the storm-related discharges from Highbridge sewage works in February 2016. Plans to increase storm storage capacity to reduce the occurrence of wet weather sewage spills are in progress at Highbridge, Bridgwater, Cannington, Combwich and Taunton. Improvements to  existing sewage treatment processes are planned for Dunball, Cannington and Combwich by 2018. The Environment Agency is also working with Wessex Water to reduce infiltration of surface water run‐off into combined sewers, further reducing the risk of sewage overflow during wet weather.

Surface water can flow into the River Brue and onto the beach from highways drains, surface water drains and rhynes (drainage ditches). This can affect bathing water quality, particularly after periods of rainfall. The Environment Agency have regularly inspected and sampled surface water outfalls.
As with many bathing waters close to urban centres, significant proportion of bathing water pollutants originate from poor practices by local residents, businesses and visitors. The Environment Agency has worked closely with Sedgemoor District Council on several public engagement activities since 2012 to promote best practice and reduce the impact of misconnections, poorly disposed of sanitary products, pet waste and other issues that block sewers or directly contaminate bathing water.

There are also two small drains that flow into the sea near the River Axe.  The Uphill Great Rhyne, controlled by a sluice gate, joins the River Axe approximately 500m before it reaches the sea. The Environment Agency has monitored the water quality of the Uphill Great Rhyne and the River Axe since 2007. During and after periods of heavy rainfall, agricultural and urban runoff to the River Axe and the Uphill Great Rhyne increases, impacting bathing water quality at Uphill Slipway.","Since 2007 the Environment Agency have carried out extensive additional monitoring in the River Axe at Brean Cross sluice and in the Uphill Great Rhyne at Uphill sluice alongside the Environment Agency routine bathing water monitoring at Weston-super-Mare.

The animal contribution is possibly more significant in the River Axe, and the human contribution more significant in the Uphill Great Rhyne. 
Between 2009 and 2013 the Environment Agency have walked the catchment in wet and dry weather conditions, and sampled various tributaries of the Uphill Great Rhyne.  In 2011, the Environment Agency identified a chronic sewer leak into the Uphill Great Rhyne, promptly fixed by Wessex Water.

There are multiple access points to the beach via boardwalks across the dunes. The beach has a shallow profile that increasingly drops off towards the sea.","The Sefton coastline stretches for approximately twenty kilometres from Southport in the north to Formby in the south. The wider catchment area around Formby is green belt land and is used for arable farming. The streams in this area drain into the River Alt which enters the Irish Sea around five kilometres south of the bathing water.","It is the Environment Agency's role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing higher standards. It is natural for water to run off the land to the sea. Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","Formby bathing water is around five kilometres north of the mouth of the River Alt. The River Alt enters the Crosby Channel (Irish Sea) and, depending on weather conditions, can reach Formby bathing water.  Short-term declines in bathing water quality at Formby have been linked to reduced water quality in the River Alt. 
Formby bathing water is located midway between the large estuaries of the River Mersey to the south and the River Ribble to the north which both drain large inland catchments. The Mersey catchment is heavily built up around the cities of Liverpool and Manchester, whilst the Ribble catchment is built up around Preston. There is a limited impact on the bathing water quality at Formby from these estuaries.","In the late 1990s Formby bathing water suffered from occasional reductions in bathing water quality. Detailed studies found no local issues that were causing the decline in quality. 
The Environment Agency has contributed to the Mersey Basin Campaign, a 25-year government-backed community initiative to improve environmental quality in the Mersey catchment area. Past and future improvements will help protect the bathing water quality at Formby.
In 2012 the Environment Agency surveyed surface water drains in this area to identify any sources of contamination. No contaminated surface waters were found.","United Utilities has upgraded many of its sewage treatment works and storm overflows leading to significant water quality improvements. The sites upgraded close to Formby are Liverpool Sewage Treatment Works in 1999, Bromborough Sewage Treatment Works in 2000 and Birkenhead Sewage Treatment Works in 2001. 
A major sewer interceptor scheme known as the Mersey Estuary Pollution Alleviation Scheme (MEPAS) was completed by United Utilities in 2000 to catch sewage discharges and reduce storm overflows to the Mersey. The scheme transfers sewage to Liverpool Sewage Treatment Works. This has improved the water quality in the River Mersey and has protected bathing water quality at Formby.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","Formby Sewage Treatment Works located on the River Alt was upgraded by United Utilities in 2012. The improvements were designed to improve river water quality in the River Alt which can, under certain weather conditions, impact on Formby bathing water.","The majority of sewers in England are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","Under the programme of work for United Utilities (from 2015 to 2020) storm overflows close to bathing waters will have equipment installed to monitor spills to the environment. This will help to identify where bathing water improvements may be needed in the future.","Heavy rain falling on pavements and roads often flows into surface water drains or highway drains, ending up in local rivers and ultimately the sea. The quality of bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.","To help improve bathing water quality we are working alongside Local Authorities through a LOVEmyBEACH campaign.

In 2011 the Environment Agency surveyed the catchment around Ainsdale to identify sources of contamination. Where significant issues were found we have investigated and required improvements where needed.
In 2012 the Environment Agency surveyed a surface water catchment in this area to identify any sources of contamination. The Environment Agency worked with United Utilities, the local authority and householders to resolve any issues discovered during this survey.
The Environment Agency contributed to a 4 year research project - Cloud 2 Coast - between 2011 and 2015 delivered by the Universities of Sheffield, Cardiff and Aberystwyth. The project developed river and coastal models of the Ribble catchment to understand the catchment sources which could impact bathing water quality.  The project looked at options for managing these sources to improve bathing water quality.
In 2015 the Environment Agency carried out an investigation on the impact of salt marsh grazing by sheep on bathing water quality.  This has led to a number of the north west's bathing water being included in the pollution risk forecasting system  to warn bathers of a predicted reduction in bathing water quality due to high spring tides washing animal manures from the salt marsh.","Whilst there are no water company assets discharging directly to the beach at Ainsdale there are a number located on the River Ribble and its estuary which can impact Ainsdale’s bathing water quality particularly after rainfall.

The wider catchment has mixed use with the land immediately behind the beach being predominantly urban and becoming more agricultural further inland. The River Ribble discharges to the sea approximately five kilometres south of the bathing water.","It is the Environment Agency's role to drive improvement of water quality at bathing waters that are at risk of failing higher standards. It is natural for water to run off the land to the sea. Water quality at a bathing water is dependent upon the type and area of land (the catchment) draining to the water and the activities undertaken in that catchment.","The River Ribble can cause reduced water quality at St Annes North particularly after rainfall.","Since 1997 the Environment Agency has studied the Ribble Estuary to identify potential impacts on the bathing waters at the mouth of the estuary, including St Annes North. 
A computer model has been developed to predict the impact of pollution sources, including water company discharges, on bathing water quality. 
The Environment Agency can use a DNA identification technique to help show whether sources of pollution are of human or animal origin. In 2009 and 2010 this method was used at St Annes North and has helped target Environment Agency investigations and identify corrective action.
In 2011 the Environment Agency surveyed streams around St Annes North to identify sources of contamination. The significant issues found have been investigated and improvements made where needed.
The Environment Agency contributed to a 4 year research project - Cloud 2 Coast - between 2011 and 2015 delivered by the Universities of Sheffield, Cardiff and Aberystwyth. The project developed river and coastal models of the Ribble catchment to understand the catchment sources which could impact bathing water quality.  The project looked at options for managing these sources to improve bathing water quality.
In 2015 the Environment Agency carried out an investigation on the impact of salt marsh grazing by sheep on bathing water quality.  This has led to a number of the north west's bathing water being included in the pollution risk forecasting system  to warn bathers of a predicted reduction in bathing water quality due to high spring tides washing animal manures from the salt marsh.","There are a number of water company assets located on the River Ribble and its estuary which can affect St Annes North bathing water quality. The Environment Agency has worked closely with United Utilities since the 1990s to make significant improvements to the sewerage infrastructure around St Annes North bathing water. 
Sea Change, a £500 million coastal clean-up, was launched in 1994 by the Environment Agency in conjunction with United Utilities, to improve the bathing water quality in the North West, particularly along the Fylde Coast. Under this programme United Utilities made improvements at Fairhaven Pumping Station to reduce storm overflows to the sea, upgraded Preston Sewage Treatment Works and built a new sewage treatment works at Southport which will have improved bathing water quality at St Annes. 
Over the last 20 years United Utilities has provided disinfection at Southport, Wigan, Skelmersdale, Hesketh Bank and Preston Sewage Treatment Works to improve bathing water quality. Large storage tanks have also been built at Preston, Wigan and Southport Sewage Treatment Works to reduce the storm overflows. Improvements have also been made to the Fairhaven, Lytham and Ballam Road Pumping Stations to protect bathing water quality. 
In the late 1990s storage was provided by United Utilities at three inland locations in Preston (Haslam Park, Cattle Market and Ramsay Avenue) to protect river and bathing water quality. These discharges were further improved between 2003 and 2005.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","There are a number of sewage treatment works, including Southport and Preston, which can impact St Annes bathing water quality.  However, they all have disinfection provided ensuring bathing water quality is protected.  
During 2012 United Utilities upgraded Blackburn Sewage Treatment Works providing disinfection to deliver bathing water improvements.","The majority of sewers in England are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","The Sandgate Pumping Station, Abercorn Place, and the Wetherby & Albany Avenue overflows located to the north of the bathing water are no longer in use. The flows have been diverted away from the bathing water by United Utilities. 
There are numerous storm, emergency and surface water outfalls that discharge to the River Ribble and its estuary. Sewer overflows operating during, and following, periods of heavy rain, can result in a fall in quality of bathing water at St Annes North. Fairhaven Pumping Station, which discharges to the south of St Annes North bathing water, has undergone significant investment to protect bathing water quality. In addition, a significant improvement programme to overflows around the Preston area was completed by United Utilities in 2013 to protect bathing water quality. The programme included the construction of a large storage tunnel (40,790 m3) to the south of the River Ribble to store storm flows as well as a number of other individual schemes to improve storm and emergency overflows.
As part of the improvement programme of work for United Utilities (from 2015 to 2020) the storm overflows from Chorley, Blackburn and Preston Sewage Treatment Works will be improved to protect bathing water quality.  The programme also requires that all storm overflows close to bathing waters have equipment installed to monitor spills to the environment.

In 2010 United Utilities upgraded Fleetwood Sewage Treatment Works. This has improved the sewerage system on the Fylde coast by reducing storm and emergency overflows to the sea.
In 2013 United Utilities upgraded Garstang Sewage Treatment Works on the River Wyre improving the treatment of the discharge through disinfection to protect bathing water quality.","The majority of sewers in England are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","In 2013 United Utilities improved the storm storage provisions at Garstang Sewage Treatment Works.  Improvements completed in 2014 to a further four storm overflows located on the Wyre Estuary have improved bathing water quality. 
As part of the improvement programme of work for United Utilities (from 2015 to 2020) further work to reduce the number of storm discharges from the Manchester Square, Anchorsholme and Chatsworth Avenue Pumping Stations is planned to improve bathing water quality on the Fylde coast in Lancashire.

Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.
Between January and March 2012 the Environment Agency surveyed surface water catchments close to Fleetwood bathing water to identify any sources of contamination. This work led to the investigation of four surface water catchments for misconnections by United Utilities in 2014 and 2015.  The Environment Agency are working with United Utilities, the local authority and householders to resolve misconnection issues identified in the survey.","The land around Fleetwood is urban with little agricultural land bordering the seafront.

This has resulted in a new system providing improved sewage treatment and disinfection at a caravan park near Allonby South bathing water. There is further on-going work in the catchment to address other sites and the Environment Agency is working with site owners to ensure that any improvements are completed as soon as possible.
In 2011 the Environment Agency surveyed the catchment around Allonby South to identify sources of contamination. Where significant issues were found these have been investigated and improvements made where needed.
In 2012 United Utilities, with the Environment Agency's support, developed a detailed model of the Solway Estuary and the north Cumbrian coast to assess which inputs can impact bathing water quality. The River Ellen and Allonby Sewage Treatment Works were identified as the main impacts on bathing water quality.  This information has been used to inform the United Utilities investment programme.","Sea Change, a £500 million coastal clean-up project, was launched in 1994 by the Environment Agency in conjunction with United Utilities. It’s aim was to improve the bathing water quality in the North West. Through this a £30 million scheme to improve the sewerage system in the Maryport area was established. The scheme eliminated a large crude discharge at Maryport by passing flows south to Workington, constructed a new outfall at Maryport for storm flows, and removed eight storm overflows as part of the overall Maryport sewerage scheme. A new sewage treatment works was also built at Alllonby four kilometres to the north of the Allonby South bathing water.
Allerby Sewage Treatment Works was upgraded in 2005 to improve water quality in the Brunsow Beck which flows across the bathing water. Crosscanonby Sewage Treatment Works three kilometres to the south of Allonby South bathing water, and Edderside Sewage Treatment Works six kilometres to the north of the bathing water, were also upgraded in 2005 by United Utilities to improve river quality. The upgrades will have improved bathing water quality.","Discharges from sewage treatment works have improved substantially in England since the 1980s.","Allonby Sewage Treatment Works discharges to Allonby Bay to the north of Allonby village. Allonby Sewage treatment Works discharges to Allonby Bay. The discharge from the sewage treatment works is treated to a high standard. United Utilities upgraded the sewage treatment works in 2003 to ensure the discharge receives disinfection to protect bathing water quality.","The majority of sewers in England are “combined sewers” and carry both sewage and surface water from roofs and drains. A storm overflow operates during heavy rainfall when the sewerage system becomes overwhelmed by the amount of surface water. The overflow prevents sewage from backing up pipes and flooding properties and gardens. An emergency overflow will only operate infrequently, for example due to pump failure or blockage in the sewerage system.","The storm overflow from Allonby Sewage Treatment Works discharges to Allonby Bay at the same location as the treated discharge from the sewage treatment works. The storm overflow from Allonby Sewage Treatment Works was improved in March 2016 to protect bathing water quality by reducing the number of storm discharges.  
The storm overflow from Maryport Pumping Station is located six kilometres to the south of Allonby bathing water. An improvement scheme for Maryport Pumping Station designed to protect bathing water quality was completed in March 2012.
Under the programme of work for United Utilities (from 2015 to 2020) all storm overflows close to bathing waters will have equipment installed to monitor spills to the environment. This will help to identify where bathing water improvements may be needed in the future.
This bathing water is included in the Surfers Against Sewage “Safer Seas Service”. This service can alert you to Combined Storm Sewer Overflow discharges via a phone App and in addition, it includes the Environment Agency Pollution Risk Forecast warnings where they are available.

The quality of bathing water may be adversely affected as a result of such events.","To help improve bathing water quality we are working alongside Local Authorities through a LOVEmyBEACH campaign. Further information can be found at http://lovemybeach.org/","Modern sewerage systems have two separate systems, one takes foul sewage to sewage treatment, the other takes rainwater runoff through surface water drains to rivers, lakes and the sea. Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.
In 2015 United Utilities investigated, and where issues found taken action to resolve, two misconnections close to Allonby South under their improvement programme.","The River Ellen catchment lying behind the Allonby bathing waters is agricultural with large areas of land used for livestock. During and following periods of heavy rainfall, run off from agricultural areas will be greatly increased which could impact bathing water quality at Allonby South.   
Catchment Sensitive Farming, delivered by Natural England in partnership with the Environment Agency, delivers practical solutions and targeted support to enable farmers and land managers to take voluntary action to reduce diffuse water pollution from agriculture to protect water bodies and the environment.  Actions include a programme of educational events for farmers, advice to farmers and land managers, farm visits, and surveys of the area to identify pollution risks. A project is currently underway within the River Ellen catchment focusing on reducing the bathing water quality impact from farms. 
In 2013 funding was given for a 'Catchment Wise' project in the River Ellen catchment.  The project is a partnership between the West Cumbria Rivers Trust, United Utilities and Natural England’s Catchment Sensitive Farming Project to tackle agricultural diffuse pollution in rivers and streams across the catchment. The project brings together farmers, landowners and local communities to protect water quality by considering grazing regimes, livestock housing, fencing, tree planting and advising on best practice to prevent  pollution. One of the aims of the project is to improve bathing water quality in Allonby Bay.","The Sellafield nuclear site is located on the West Cumbrian coast just north of the village of Seascale. The site which covers an area around four square kilometres is bordered on the western edge by the coastline. The Environment Agency permits waste disposal from the site, including discharges via a pipeline into the Irish Sea. The Environment Agency monitors seawater, sediment and seaweed at beaches in West Cumbria and publishes the results in an annual Radioactivity in Food and Environment Report (https://www.gov.uk/monitoring-radioactivity).
